The program gets torrent files for music made by a list of artists. Currently
this list is generated from the liked artists of members of a Facebook group
you are in, but I'll probably add option for other sources too, like a simple
text file.

Please make sure to set a download path for the torrent files in config.py!

Also, sorry about stupidities in my code, I'm just starting to learn Python.
Any feedback is appreciated, though!

Currently on my to do list:
 - Add progress indicators to be displayed during long tasks
 - Set up network error handling
 - [URGENT] Display the isohunt.com torrent detail pages, to comply with their
   API's terms of use.
